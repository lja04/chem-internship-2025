# Summer Internship Project: Molecular Crystal Analysis and Computation

This repository contains the code, scripts, and resources developed during my summer internship focused on advanced molecular crystal structure analysis, computational chemistry workflows, and cheminformatics.

## Overview

- **Calculations and Job Automation:** Scripts for organizing molecule data, running calculations (AutoLD, AutoFree), and managing HPC jobs including Slurm batch scripts.
- **Data Processing:** Utilities for filtering, validating, and organizing crystal structure data in preparation for computational workflows.
- **Modular Processing:** The processing pipeline broken into modular stages allowing stepwise data manipulation and flexible debugging.
- **Molecular Fingerprinting:** Implementations of molecular fingerprint generation and diverse sample selection algorithms using RDKit and DeepChem.
- **Job Scripts:** Example Slurm job submission files illustrating HPC batch processing experience.

## Features

- Fully automated data preparation and calculation pipelines.
- Management of raw and processed crystal structure and energy calculation files.
- Use of cheminformatics tools to generate fingerprints and perform molecular diversity selections.
- HPC cluster job scheduling demonstrated through Slurm scripts.
- Clear modularization of complex processing tasks for ease of customization and maintenance.
