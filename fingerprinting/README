# Molecular Fingerprinting and Sampling

Contains scripts to generate molecular fingerprints and perform farthest point sampling using cheminformatics libraries.

Features:
- ECFP (Extended Connectivity Fingerprints) generation from SMILES strings.
- Farthest point sampling algorithm for molecular diversity.
- Visualization of sampling results with clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Essential for chemical diversity analysis and sample selection in cheminformatics workflows.

## Usage

Run fingerprint and sampling scripts with SMILES input files to obtain diverse molecular subsets for study.
